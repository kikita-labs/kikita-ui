# Component Roadmap

## Phase 1

- Theme foundation
- Icon abstraction
- Button
- IconButton
- Field
- Input
- Group
- Playground component board

## Phase 2

- Signal Forms integration spike (native `kuiInput` + Angular `[formField]` proven)
- Textarea (done as `textarea[kuiTextarea]`)
- Checkbox (done as `input[type=checkbox][kuiCheckbox]`)
- Switch (done as `input[type=checkbox][kuiSwitch]`)
- Radio (done as `input[type=radio][kuiRadio]`)
- Badge (done as `[kuiBadge]`)
- Loader (done as `[kuiLoader]`)
- Tooltip (done as `[kuiTooltip]`)
- Card (done as `[kuiCard]`)
- Tabs (done as `kui-tabs`)
- Segmented (done as `kui-segmented`)
- Table primitives (done as `table[kuiTable]`; deeper static accessibility review completed, browser/AT review pending)

## Phase 3

- Select (done as `input[kuiSelect]` with `kui-dropdown` and `kuiOption`)
- Dropdown (done as `kui-dropdown` + `[kuiDropdownFor]` + `[kuiOption]`; field auto-wiring via `contentChild`)
- Popover (done as `kui-popover` + `[kuiPopoverFor]`)
- Dialog (done as `kui-dialog` + dialog service)
- Confirm (done as `kuiConfirm()` on top of Dialog)
- Toast (done as toast provider/service + viewport)
- Accordion (done as `kui-accordion`)
- Progress (done as `kui-progress`)
- Slider (done as `input[type=range][kuiSlider]`)
- Number input (done as `input[type=number][kuiNumberInput]`)

## Later

- Avatar
- Menu
- Drawer
- Combobox
- Command palette
- Skeleton
- Empty state

Do not build Datepicker, Calendar, Tree, Charts, or File Upload until a real consumer needs them.

## Install DX

Angular schematic support is implemented and verified against a fresh Angular
consumer app:

- `ng add @kikita-labs/ui`
- add `node_modules/@kikita-labs/ui/styles/kikita-ui.css` to the consumer app
- add `provideKikitaUi()` to `app.config.ts`
- optionally scaffold default Ember theme seeds with `--theme`
- verified with a local tarball in a fresh Angular 22 app outside this workspace

Initial install documentation lives in `docs/install.md`.

Docs pages exist for all implemented primitives through Number Input. Initial static accessibility review has been run for Table, Tooltip, Tabs, Segmented, Popover, Dialog, Toast, Accordion, Progress, and Slider; browser and assistive-technology review is still pending.

## Consumer Migration Gate

Keep this as the final gate of the current plan. Do not integrate Kikita UI into
an existing Taiga UI surface until the package install flow, browser review, and
accessibility review are stable.

Before migrating `discord-bot` screens, Kikita UI should reach a coherent MVP:

- Phase 1 is published privately.
- Signal Forms direction is proven.
- Textarea, Checkbox, Switch, and Radio exist.
- Badge, Loader, and Card exist.
- Playground covers tokens, theme, states, forms, density, light/dark, and mobile checks.
- Public docs and JSDoc exist for exported primitives.
- Install DX is verified against a fresh Angular app.
- Browser and assistive-technology review is complete for overlay and table primitives.

Current primitive state coverage is tracked in `docs/state-coverage.md`.

After that, migrate one isolated low-risk screen first. Avoid mixed Taiga/Kikita
surfaces unless the screen is explicitly a migration sandbox.
